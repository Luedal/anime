                Monkey D. Luffy,[1] also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[4] is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, OnePiece. He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon,[19] the paternal grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[20] the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. Luffy is a pirate and his lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.[21] He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[22] He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives the consumer's body the properties of rubber.[23] As the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, he is the first member of the crew, as well as one of its top three fighters.[24]

                Luffy has a worldwide reputation for causing trouble, challenging the Shichibukai, the Marines, and the Yonko, additionally committing felonies and actions which were deemed threatening by the World Government. Furthermore, in the majority of these confrontations, he has emerged as the victor. He has gained a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane", after causing an incident in Enies Lobby, assaulting a World Noble at Sabaody Archipelago, entering and escaping from Impel Down, and joining the Battle of Marineford. He is, therefore, infamous for being the only known pirate to not only deliberately attack the three most important government facilities, but also escape from all of them alive after facing incredibly powerful opponents in each one. The additional fact that he punched a World Noble with full knowledge of the consequences, as well as his heritage, has caused Luffy to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki and Marine Headquarters.[25]
                
                These acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of Beli500,000,000, one of the highest past or present bounties in the series. Having had a bounty of Beli300,000,000 prior to his arrival at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who has reached the Red Line, pirates with bounties over Beli100,000,000[26] who would go on to be referred as the "Worst Generation".[27]
